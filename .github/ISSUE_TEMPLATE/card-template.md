### Description / Problem

Guiding questions: What do we want to implement? What is the problem?
For example:

- As a customer: I would like to have the option to pay with PayPal, as this speeds up the payment.
- As an organizer: I want my customers to pay via PayPal, as this significantly reduces the complexity of the payment.

### Solution

Describe the solution in a technical way. For example:

- To let the customers pay with a digital payment method, we need to display a QR Code on the waiter frontend. This QR
  Code contains a link that offers the payment through PayPal. In order to process the payment, we need to implement the
  PayPal API.
